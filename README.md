# What is this mod?
Buttons on your Wrist!

## Manual Installation
Be sure that you are already installed BepInEx (using MonkeModManager for example). You need x64 version. [Take it there.](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)

If your BepInEx copy installed then copy-paste DLLs to your Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/plugins folder somewhere (Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/WristButtons/ for example).
